# Cross-Lingual Translation Using Deep Learning and NLP

This repository contains a complete cross-lingual machine translation system built using multiple deep learning architectures. The project explores various Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models, with IndicTrans2 being the primary and most effective model used for multilingual translation—especially for Indian and low-resource languages.

The goal is to implement an end-to-end translation pipeline capable of translating text across different languages using state-of-the-art NLP and deep learning techniques.
